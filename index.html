    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="IMG-CJP.jpg">
    <h2>Curtis J. Price</h2>
    <h2>"CJ" is my Nickname</h2>
    <p>     I am currently working on both CSE 111 and Web Fundamentals from BYU-I while my hobbies plastic model kits and video gaming.</p>
    <p>Unfornately I am single and unmarried, so i do not have children or grandchildren.</p>
    <p>The thing I enjoy from BYU-Idaho is the opportunity to perform group projects and assignments, where each person is assigned a task that is a part of the whole assignment, encouraging the need to work together.</p>
    <p>If I will be honest, my ambition was to take more 3D design based courses where we can learn to make #D artworks or animations. However, I had decided that this course along with it's sister classes would be perfect to expand my horizons should my dream career be walled off from opportunities. For example, if I can't partake in the 3D Grapics career, I can branch off to do Web Design in its place.</p>
    <p>I have been born and raised in the church since 1997 and have my favourite quotes is most of the new testiment, though my most favourite scripture is that of the Good Samaritan.</p>
